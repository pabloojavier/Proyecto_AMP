The file "51 - 100 - 150 city prolems.xls" is the data set obtained from Professor Arthur E. Carter, who used the data set for his EJOR paper "A new approach to solving the multiple traveling salesperson problem using genetic algorithms".

The other data sets "sp11_dist.txt", "uk12_dist.txt" and "sgb128_dist.txt" are obtained from http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/cities/cities.html

For the MTSP all the salesmen must start at the same city and return to the same city (like a bunch of trucks all leaving the same depot and returning there).  For my work I used the first city on the list as the start and finish city.  If a different city is used as the starting point there would be no valid comparison of results between the different works.
